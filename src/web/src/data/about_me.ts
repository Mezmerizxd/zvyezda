  "I want to be a Software Engineer and I have been learning since 2017 when I was 13 years old. I started out in Python using a module called Turtle to make small games. After I understood the basics I moved onto HTML & CSS and I was making simple sites for my friends on my schools computers. Then in 2020 I wanted to build a cheat for the game Grand Theft Auto V so I started using C# to manipulate values inside the game and then I switched to someone's existing cheat base that was made in C++ and that's how I learned the basics of C# & C++. From 2021 to 2022 I've been learning how to use Web Frameworks like React & Svelte and also have built some servers using ExpressJs, MySql and MongoDB.";
